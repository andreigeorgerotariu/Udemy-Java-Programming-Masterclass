package timbuchalka.collections.listAndArrayList.mobilePhoneContactsApp;

// Create a program that implements a  simple mobile phone with the following capabilities.
// Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names.
// You will want to create separate class for Contacts (name and phone number).
// Create a master class (mobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of Contacts.
// The MobilePhone Class has the functionality listed above.
// Add a menu of options that are available.
// Options: Quit, print list of contacts, add a new contact, update existing contact, remove contact and search/find contact.
// When adding or updating be sure to check if the contact already exists (use name)
// Be sure not to expose the inner workings of the Arraylist to MobilePhone.
// e.g. no ints, no .get(i) etc.
// MobilePhone should do everything with Contact objects only.
